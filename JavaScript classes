JavaScript classes were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provide a more structured and convenient way to create and work with objects in JavaScript. Classes are essentially syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance system. Here's an overview of JavaScript classes:

Creating a Class:
You can create a class using the class keyword. Classes can include constructors and methods.

javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
  }
}
Creating Objects (Instances):
To create an instance of a class, you use the new keyword with the class constructor.

javascript
Copy code
const person1 = new Person("John", "Doe");
const person2 = new Person("Alice", "Smith");

person1.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is John Doe"
person2.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is Alice Smith"
Constructor Method:
The constructor is a special method called when an object is instantiated from a class. It's used to initialize object properties.

Class Methods:
You can define methods within a class that are shared among all instances of that class.

Inheritance:
Classes support inheritance through the extends keyword. A subclass can inherit properties and methods from a superclass.

javascript
Copy code
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, studentId) {
    super(firstName, lastName); // Call the superclass constructor
    this.studentId = studentId;
  }

  // Additional methods specific to Student
  study() {
    console.log(`${this.firstName} is studying.`);
  }
}

const student = new Student("Bob", "Johnson", "12345");
student.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is Bob Johnson"
student.study(); // "Bob is studying."
Static Methods:
Static methods are methods that are called on the class itself, rather than on instances of the class. They are defined using the static keyword.

javascript
Copy code
class MathUtils {
  static square(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
}

const result = MathUtils.square(5); // Call the static method
console.log(result); // 25
Getter and Setter Methods:
Classes allow you to define getter and setter methods for controlling access to object properties.

javascript
Copy code
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this._width = width; // Private property
    this._height = height; // Private property
  }

  get area() {
    return this._width * this._height;
  }

  set width(newWidth) {
    if (newWidth > 0) {
      this._width = newWidth;
    }
  }
}

const rect = new Rectangle(5, 4);
console.log(rect.area); // 20
rect.width = 3; // Use the setter method
console.log(rect.area); // 12

JavaScript classes provide a cleaner and more organized way to create and manage objects and their behaviors, making code more readable and maintainable. They are widely used in modern JavaScript development for defining object-oriented structures.
